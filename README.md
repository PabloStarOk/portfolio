# Portfolio

Hi, I'm Pedro Pablo Rodriguez Carranza, and this is my portfolio. It is built with the Astro framework and includes my basic information, skills, personal projects, and contact details. The design is based on a Figma prototype created by me.

## Live Portfolio

Not hosted yet.

### Figma Prototypes

> [!NOTE]
> Prototypes may differ from the live due to the complexity of Figma to add transitions and animations for small projects or because some minimal features on Figma prototypes are considered unnecessary for the live.
